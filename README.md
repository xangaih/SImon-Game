# SImon-Game
This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Simon game, where players must repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery for DOM manipulation.

Features:

Start and Restart: The game begins when a key is pressed and can be restarted after a game over.  

Sequence Generation: Random color sequences are generated and displayed.

User Interaction: Players interact with the game by clicking on colored buttons to repeat the sequences.

Feedback: Visual and audio feedback is provided for both correct and incorrect sequences.

Level Tracking: The current level is displayed, increasing with each correct sequence.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structuring the game interface.

CSS: Styling the game, including button colors and game-over effects.

JavaScript: Core game logic and sequence management.

jQuery: Simplifying DOM manipulations and event handling.

Files:

index.html: Contains the game layout and includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files.

styles.css: Provides the styling for the game, including button colors, text styles, and game-
over effects.

game.js: Implements the game logic, including sequence generation, user input handling, and feedback mechanisms.

How to Run:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open index.html in a web browser.

Press any key to start the game and follow the on-screen instructions.
